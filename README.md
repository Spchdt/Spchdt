## Hi! I'm Art 🙌

A mobile developer and Computer Science student at NUS. My journey started with a love for iOS that led to two WWDC Swift Student Challenge wins, but these days I'm diving much deeper into system design and scalable software architecture. I'm a product builder at heart, and I love blending solid engineering with intuitive UX/UI to create apps that actually feel great to use.
